1) All the files extensions and regex expressions in .gitignore file are used to ignore certain files from being added into github. Typically for a java project it should ignore the following file types:
    *.class
    *.log
    *.ctxt
    .mtj.tmp/
    *.jar
    *.war
    *.nar
    *.ear
    *.zip
    *.tar.gz
    *.rar
    hs_err_pid*
    replay_pid*
2) When the new branch has commits which don't diverge from the previous branch. Git directly updates the HEAD pointer to new branch without any commit. This is called FAST FORWARD in github.

3) This allows us to always have a working copy of the application. While we can do our changes or fixes in the new branch.

4) It depends on the protocol a company has for the git. But it is usually 2. One is stage and the other one is production.
